13.	Conclusion

This is the last chapter in this book. We have covered almost all of the intermediate level concepts in Python and we covered them in great detail. We started with setting our development environment, the PyCharm IDE. Then we learned Exception Handling, Modules & Packages, Format Operations and File Operations in Python. Finally we covered one of the most important topics in computer programming which is OOP (Object Oriented Programming). We built two big projects that are the PDF & CSV Operations and the Movie Library. Especially in the Movie Library we build a real world project which you can use as a reference in your programming life. You also had assignments after the projects. And finally you got the Final Exam to test yourself.

The approach we followed in this book is quite unique and intense. It aims to teach you Python in a solid and unforgettable way. Thatâ€™s why we had more than 50 coding exercises, quizzes and assignments. The idea is to make sure we used all the possible ways to help you learn Python programming. And I hope, I achieved this.

This book is a part of the Hands-On Python Series. There are three books in this series: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced. This book is the second one, the Intermediate level. You can start the Advanced part after you finish this book and feel comfortable with the fundamentals of Python.



Dear reader!

I want to thank you with all my heart, for your interest in my book, your patience and your desire to learn Python. You did a great job finishing this intense book. And I am very happy to be a part of this. I hope we see each other again in another programming book. Till then, I hope, you have wonderful life and reach your dreams. 


Good bye.
